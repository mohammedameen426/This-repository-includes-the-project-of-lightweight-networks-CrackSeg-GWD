Datasets used on this study:
1. The SteelCrack dataset is a widely used benchmark for steel crack detection and segmentation. The dataset is divided into 3,300 training images, 525 validation images, and 530 test images, offering a well-balanced split for deep learning–based segmentation studies. "Z. He, W. Chen, J. Zhang, Y.H. Wang, Crack segmentation on steel structures using boundary guidance model, Autom Constr 162 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105354."

2. The YCD dataset contains images of two main types of surface defects: road cracks and concrete wall cracks. The dataset includes 776 images, split into 622 for training and 154 for testing. All images were resized to 512 × 512, matching the preprocessing used for other datasets such as DeepCrack537. Figure 7 shows sample images that reflect the dataset’s diversity in crack types and scales. "X. Yang, H. Li, Y. Yu, X. Luo, T. Huang, X.

6. Crack Dataset: This dataset contains 128 high-resolution crack images (3024 × 3024) collected from sections of Qingyuan Road, split into 102 for training and 26 for testing. The images include real-world challenges such as strong shadows, uneven lighting, surface noise, and complex textures.These samples are used to test and evaluate the robustness of our model.
